<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
My name is Jiarong Chen. I studied at the School of Biomedical Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University from 2017 to 2021, where I obtained my bachelor's degree. From 2021 to 2024, I pursued my master's degree at the same institution, under the guidance of Dr. Wu Wanqing. Since 2024, I have embarked on my doctoral journey at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the mentorship of Professor Wang Guoxing. Currently, my research interests include generative artificial intelligence, digital health, AI for healthcare, bio-signal processing (mainly ECG and PPG), and cardiovascular health. I have published my research findings in several journals, including IEEE IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Expert Systems With Applications, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Applied Soft Computing.
